# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi there! I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href='https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/onderzoek/augment'>Augment Research Group</a> at the Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven supervised by <a href='https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/onderzoek/augment/katrien-verbert'>Prof. Katrien Verbert</a> and <a href='https://yucheng.gold/'>Dr. Yucheng Jin</a>.

Previously, I worked as a RA at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of<a href='https://person.zju.edu.cn/chaowu'> Prof. Chao Wu</a>. I received my master’s degree in Human–Computer Interaction from Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University (in collaboration with the University of Liverpool) in March 2024, advised by <a href='https://yulingyun.com/'>Prof. Lingyun Yu</a>. Before that, I earned my bachelor’s degree from Nanjing Xiaozhuang University in July 2021, supervised by  <a href='https://ie.njxzc.edu.cn/1037/listm.htm'>Prof. Hao Zheng</a>.  

My research focuses on **enabling large language models to interact with users in a more transparent, controllable, and personalized manner, thereby helping users better understand and utilize the models**. In my academic journey, I have been fortunate to collaborate closely with <a href='https://zhenwang9102.github.io/'> Dr. Zhen Wang</a>, from whom I have learned a great deal.
